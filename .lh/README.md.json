The main application provides a text-based menu to add/remove employees, terminate service, manage vacations, and display reports by department.\n\nKey concepts illustrated:\n- Abstract classes and inheritance (`Employee`, `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, `LongServingEmployee`) 🔧\n- Object composition (`Section` containing `Employee` instances) 🧩\n- Polymorphism and method overriding (`report()`, `addVacation()`, `getVacation()`) 🔁\n- Basic multi-threading example (`Trying` class) 🧵\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Features\n\n- Add / Remove employees\n- Track employee status (serving / retired)\n- Compute and display vacations and pay\n- Department (section) reports with heads and employees\n- Examples of small utility classes (`Building`, `Hospital`, `School`, `Student`, `Person`)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Technologies\n\n- Java (SE)\n- No external dependencies\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started (Windows)\n\nOpen a command prompt and run the following commands from the project root.\n\n### Compile (from repository root)\n\n```cmd\ncd Programming_2\\src\njavac *.java\n```\n\nThis compiles all classes into the current directory (you may prefer to use the `-d` option to place class files in an output folder).\n\n### Run\n\n```cmd\njava JAVA\n```\n\nThe program will display an interactive menu where you can manage employees and view reports.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Main Files & What They Do\n\n- `JAVA.java` — Application entry point and interactive menu (adds/removes employees, queries vacations, prints reports).\n- `Employee.java` — Abstract base class for employees.\n- `FullTimeEmployee.java` — Full-time employee implementation (salary, leave calc).\n- `LongServingEmployee.java` — Long-serving employee (extended leave logic).\n- `PartTimeEmployee.java` — Part-time employee (hourly pay calculation).\n- `Section.java` — Department container; keeps an `Employee` head and a list of employees.\n- `Trying.java` — Small thread example that generates random doubles and sleeps.\n- `Building.java`, `Hospital.java`, `School.java`, `Person.java`, `Student.java`, `Operation.java` — Additional example classes used to demonstrate simple class hierarchies and methods.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Usage Notes & Examples\n\n- The program uses console input. Follow the on-screen prompts to select menu options and enter data.\n- When adding employees you will be prompted for name, address, birthdate, and type-specific info (years of service or worked hours).\n- Example menu options shown in `JAVA.java` include adding employees, deleting, ending service, adding vacation days, showing retired employees, and printing sections.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Contribution\n\nThis repository is intended for learning and demonstration. If you want to contribute improvements (better input validation, tests, persistence, or a GUI), feel free to open a pull request or create an issue describing your changes.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 License\n\nThis project contains example educational code and does not include a formal license file. Add a license if you plan to publish or share beyond course use.\n\n---\n\n## Author\n\n- Student project — created for Programming 2 (Damascus University)\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Add a sample run log or screenshots ✅\n- Add unit tests with JUnit ✅\n- Improve input validation and error handling ✅\n\nLet me know which of these you'd like next! ✨\n"
